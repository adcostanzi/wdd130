    <p>Hi everyone! I am originally from Argentina but now living in Winnipeg, Canada (yes, its cold, but only during the 8 months long winter).<br>
     I am married and have 4 little children (age range from 6 years to 4 months!) so as you can guess life is busy! I started BYU Pathway last <br>
     year after a long wait, it almost seemed impossible to go back school until my wife presented this wonderful program to me, it has been such<br>
     a bleesing for me!
    </p>
    <p>I have to say that spending time with my family is on top of my hobbie list, I can't be 100% happy if I am not around them. I love traveling,<br>
        kayaking (or anything with paddles), making bbq's and being outside, at least when I can be outside. Because I live in Winnipeg winters are <br>
        really cold (-40 Celsius) and I tend to be inside for obviuos reasons. I am excited to work with you and learn from you!!
    </p>
    <p>Cheers,<br>
    Andres
