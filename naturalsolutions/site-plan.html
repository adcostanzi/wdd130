      <h3>Our Process</h3>
      <p>
        Manufacturing can be a very broad field, so when choosing a manufacturer, it is important to have a clear idea of what you want. Next, we will explain how to take your idea from a simple thought to something tangible and visible.
        
          1- Establish and develop your idea:

          After you discover a viable product idea, take some time to refine your concept. Determine whether your product represents an industrial item for a construction process or a consumer product for everyday customers, as this classification may inform what type of manufacturer to hire in the future. Remember that Natural Solutions is solely focused on consumer products and its team of experts can guide you through steps 3 to 6.

          2-	Research the idea:
Research every important aspect before following this process. It is important that you analyze prospective buyers, how the market behaves on the industry and the competition. This can be a though step but it will be worth it if you do it correctly.
3-	Design/Formulation of the product:
This is the step where Natural Solutions steps right in. Our team of experts can answer your inquiries and guide you through the though process of choosing the right raw materials, packaging and logistics solutions. With over 10 years of experience our professionals will inform you of the latest trends and market’s demands along with unique perspective on formulations achieving the best performance results possible.

4-	Creating a prototype:
With our different packages of promotions, we can definitely help you launch the idea that you were exactly thinking. Prototypes are a must-do in order to get the right product for the right cost. A prototype allows both our customer and our team to develop an efficient and sustainable manufacturing process.

5-	Manufacturing:
This is an important step. The manufacturing plan involves MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity), production timeline, process expenses and quality assurance.
6-	Commercialize!
Once you get your first batch, the only thing you need to do is sell, sell and sell! Our team will be with you in each and every step of the process and will create a plan even to scale up production if needed.
